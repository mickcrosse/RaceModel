# RaceModel
A MATLAB toolbox for testing the race model on RTs generated using a redundant signals paradigm. Compares multisensory RTs to the statistical facilitation predicted by the unisensory RTs. The race model can be generated under the assumption that RTs on separate sensory channels are statistically independent (Raab's model), perfectly negatively dependent (Miller's bound) or perfectly positively dependent (Grice's bound).
