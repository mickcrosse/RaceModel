# RaceModel
A MATLAB toolbox for testing the race model on RTs generated using a redundant signals paradigm. Compares CDFs of multisnesory RTs to the predicted statistical facilitation based on the CDFs of the unisensory RTs. The race model can be generated under the asumption that RTs on separate sensory channels are statistically independent (Raab's model), perfectly negatively dependent (Miller's bound) or perfectly positively dependent (Grice's bound).
