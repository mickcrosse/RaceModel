# RaceModel
RaceModel is a psychophysics toolbox for testing the race model on reaction times (RTs) generated using a redundant signals paradigm. Bi- or tri-sensory RT distributions can be compared the statistical facilitation predicted by the unisensory RT distributions. The race model can be generated under the assumption that RTs on separate sensory channels are statistically independent (Raab's model), perfectly negatively dependent (Miller's bound) or perfectly positively dependent (Grice's bound). RaceModel provides rountines for computing geometric measures of multisensory gain, empirical and predicted benefits as well as modality switch effects.
